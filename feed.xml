When we are planning to place implants we take a state of the art 3D CBCT Scan which we will then use to place the implant in the ideal position. Depending on what we see in the scan it may even be possible to place the new tooth on the same day as the implant is placed. When well placed and well looked after implants can last an incredibly long time and are not susceptible to decay.&lt;/p&gt;
